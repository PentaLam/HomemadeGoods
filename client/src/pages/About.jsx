                should hold the power to distribute valuable goods via their local communities. We ask you as a 
                consumer to not shop for items from your local superstore, but from your more community of local 
                sellers. In this time of crisis we beleive that people are in dire need of business and what better than 
                a socety of a globalized world shopping from their local community.</p>
